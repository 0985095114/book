\section{The Structure Identity Principle}
\label{sec:sip}
The {\em Structure Identity Principle (SIP)} is an informal principle
that expresses that isomorphic structures are identical.  We aim to
prove a general abstract result which can be applied to a wide family
of notions of structure, where structures may be many-sorted or even
dependently-sorted, they may be infinitary and they may be higher
order.  

The simplest kind of single-sorted structure consists of a type with
no additional structure.  The Univalence Axiom expresses SIP for that
notion of structure in a strong form: For types $A,B$, the
canonical function $EAB: (A=B)\ra (A\simeq B)$ such that
$EAA\refl{A}=1_A$, for each type $A$, is an equivalence.

We start with a precategory $X$.  In application to SIP for
single-sorted first order structures $X$ will be the category of sets.
We will define a precategory of $\Omega$-structures, $A =
Str_\Omega(X)$ over $X$, for an abstract signature $\Omega = (P,H)$,
where $Px$ is a set for $x:X$ and $H$ will be specified below.  The
type of objects of $A$ is the type $A_0 = \Sigma_{x:X}\; Px$.  If
$a=(x,\alpha):A_0$ then let $|a| := x$.  $H$ assigns to $a,b:A_0$ and
$f:|a|\ra |b|$ a proposition $Habf$.  This function $H$ must satisfy
the following conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Haa1_a$ for $a:A_0$.
\item $Habf\ra Hbcg\ra Hac(g\circ f)$ for $a,b,c:A_0$ and $f:|a|\ra |b|$, $g:|b|\ra |c|$.
\item $\leq_x$ is a partial order for $x:X_0$ where, for $\alpha,\alpha':Px$, 
  \[ \alpha\leq_x\alpha'\;  := H(x,\alpha)(x,\alpha')1_x.\]
\end{enumerate}
Note that (i) expresses the reflexivity of each $\leq_x$ and (ii)
implies the transitivity of each $\leq_x$.  So that (iii) only adds to
(i) and (ii) the anti-symmetry property of a partial order.  If only
(i) and (ii) hold we call $\Omega$ a pre-signature.

It should now be clear, given a precategory $X$ and a presignature
$\Omega =(P,H)$, how to make $A_0$ into a precategory with type $A_0$
of objects and, for objects $a,b$, the set $hom_A(a,b) :=
\Sigma_{f:|a|\ra |b|}Habf$ of maps $f:a\ra b$.

Our abstract form of SIP is the following result.
\begin{thm} \label{thm:sip}
If $X$ is a category and $\Omega$ is a signature then the precategory 
$Str_\Omega(X)$ is a category.
\end{thm}
