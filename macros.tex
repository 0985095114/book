%%%% THEOREM ENVIRONMENTS %%%%

% Hyperref includes the command \autoref{...} which is like \ref{...}
% except that it automatically inserts the type of the thing you're
% referring to, e.g. it produces "Theorem 3.8" instead of just "3.8"
% (and makes the whole thing a hyperlink).  This saves a slight amount
% of typing, but more importantly it means that if you decide later on
% that 3.8 should be a Lemma or a Definition instead of a Theorem, you
% don't have to change the name in all the places you referred to it.

% The following hack improves on this by using the same counter for
% all theorem-type environments, so that after Theorem 1.1 comes
% Corollary 1.2 rather than Corollary 1.1.  This makes it much easier
% for the reader to find a particular theorem when flipping through
% the document.
\makeatletter
\def\defthm#1#2{%
  %% All types of theorems are numbered inside sections
  \newtheorem{#1}{#2}[section]%
  %% This command tells hyperref's \autoref what to call things
  \expandafter\def\csname #1autorefname\endcsname{#2}%
  %% This makes all the theorem counters secretly the same counter
  \expandafter\let\csname c@#1\endcsname\c@thm}

% Now define a bunch of theorem-type environments.
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]
\newcommand{\thmautorefname}{Theorem}
%\defthm{prop}{Proposition}   % Probably we shouldn't use "Proposition" in this way
\defthm{cor}{Corollary}
\defthm{lem}{Lemma}
% Since definitions and theorems in type theory are synonymous, should
% we actually use the same theoremstyle for them?

%%%% EQUATION NUMBERING %%%%

% The following hack uses the single theorem counter to number
% equations as well, so that we don't have both Theorem 1.1 and
% equation (1.1).
\let\c@equation\c@thm
\numberwithin{equation}{section}

%%%% ENUMERATE NUMBERING %%%%

% Number the first level of enumerates as (i), (ii), ...
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\theenumi}


%%%% MARGINS %%%%

% This is a matter of personal preference, but I think the left
% margins on enumerates and itemizes are too wide.
\setitemize[1]{leftmargin=2em}
\setenumerate[1]{leftmargin=*}
