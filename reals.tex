topological reals vs contractible reals.

Two well-known constructions of reals. Cauchy Dedekind, we look at both.
1. Cauchy 
  a. performing the Cauchy construction on the rational once is probablematic
  b. performing any construction ending with a quotient is probablematic
  c. But Hits work
  d. we get the minimal cmplete field.
  e. We obtain an hset, becase approx is a Prop
2.
  a. Recall two-side cuts definition
  b. discuss issues of size and impredicativity
  c. replace Prop with the sigma-frame (Simpson), using HITs
  d. Dedekind complete field, completeness wrt sigma-frames
  e. This is a subset of an hSet
3. comparison C+D
  a. Cauchy embeds in Dedekind, we do not expect them to be the same 
     (sheaf model over the reals) Note, we do not use univalence, hence we have models in sSh(X).
  b. They are the same if we have CAC for Sigma-predicates
     Also, Sigma = 2^N/\sim
4. Heine-Borel... Locales, or formal spaces, would be an alternative. The usual arguments apply, but we will not go into them.
5. We obtain constructive mathematics, without countable choice. Little investigated.
   See Richman. Note, we are still predicative.
6. With classical logic, we have Sigma=bool and fan-theorem, Heine-Borel.
