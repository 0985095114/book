\chapter{Classical Set Theory}
\label{cha:set-math}

Our conception of sets as types with simple homotopy structure, cf.\
\autoref{sec:basics-sets}, is at odds with the Zermelo-Frankel sets which form a
cummulative hierarchy. For many purposes the homotopy-theoretic sets are just as good as
the Zermelo-Fraenkel ones, but there are also important differences. We address these in
the present chapter.

\section{Excluded Middle and the Axiom of Choice}
\label{sec:excl-middle-axiom}

\textbf{TODO:} Discuss excluded middle and choice, state that the appropriate versions are
consistent, so me may assume them. Prove that choice implies excluded middle?

\section{Sets and Classes}
\label{sec:sets-classes}

\textbf{TODO:} Discuss the role of universes as classes-of-classes-of-classes, or
alternatively as inaccessible sets.

\section{Powersets}
\label{sec:powersets}

\textbf{TODO:} Point out that we get \textbf{powerclasses} when we consider $X \to \prop$, that the
powerset axiom is about powerclasses being sets, that this is equivalent to $\prop$ being
a set, so resizing comes into play.

For a set $X$, we speak of predicates $Y:X\to \prop$ equivalently as \textbf{subsets} of $X$, and sometimes write $x\in Y$ to mean $Y(x)$.
We will also use the set-builder notation for such subsets:
\[ \setof{x:X | P } \defeq \lambda x.P \]
Univalence for \prop, plus function extensionality, implies that such subsets are \emph{extensional} in the usual sense of set theory:
\[ (Y_1 = Y_2) \leftrightarrow \Big(\prd{x:X} (x\in Y_1) \leftrightarrow (x\in Y_2)\Big) \]
Note that both sides of this equivalence are mere propositions.

We define the \textbf{power set} of $X$ to be
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{P} X &\defeq X\to \prop
\end{align*}
Likewise, we define the subset of inhabited subsets in $X$ to be
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{P}_+ X &\defeq \setof{P:X\to \prop | \brck{(\exists x:X), P(x)}}
\end{align*}
Assuming excluded middle, we have $\mathcal{P}_+ X \cong \setof{P:X\to \prop | P \neq (\lambda x.\bot)}$ and also $\mathcal{P} X \cong \mathcal{P}_+ X + \unit$.

For $Y:\mathcal{P}X$, we write $X\setminus Y \defeq \setof{x:X | x\notin Y}$.
Similarly, we have unions $Y_1 \cup Y_2$, intersections $Y_1 \cap Y_2$, and so on.

\section{The cumulative hierarchy}
\label{sec:cumulative-hierarchy}

Construction of $V$ as a HIT, mimicking Peter Aczel's construction of a type-theoretic
model of CZF.
