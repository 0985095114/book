Although this book is an experiment in \emph{informal} type theory, something must be said about the important role played by the formalization of this work in computer proof assistants.  As explained in the introduction, Univalent Foundations is closely tied to the idea of a foundation of mathematics that can be implemented in a proof assistant; although such a formalization is not part of this book, this goal has guided the development of the theory in an essential way. Indeed, in many cases, the material presented here was done first in the fully formalized setting inside a proof assistant, and only later ``unformalized" to arrive at the informal presentation you find before you --- a remarkable inversion of the usual state of affairs in formalized mathematics.   A large and growing library of code in Coq and Agda currently exists, in which much of theory presented here has been formalized.  The interested reader can find this library at {\tt homotopytypetheory.org}.

Special thanks are due to the Institute for Advanced Study, without which this book would obviously never have come to be --- but which, moreover, proved to be a stimulating and thoroughly enjoyable forge for this new field of mathematics.  We herewith commit it to the flames of public opinion; may it be sufficiently hardened and tempered to stand the test.
