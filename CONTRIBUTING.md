We are more than happy to receive pull requests which fix typos, as
long they are the really obvious kind (e.g. a spelling error,
inserting a ~ to prevent an unfortunate linebreak) that won't generate
any additional work for us.  We are not at the moment asking for
general pull requests from the public, although we might do that after
an initial release.

We are very grateful everyone who is showing interest in our project,
and to anyone who helps us improve it!  However, in order to avoid any
misunderstanding later, we should mention upfront that your
contributions will only be recorded on github commit logs, but not in
the book itself (because the book is officially an IAS project).
