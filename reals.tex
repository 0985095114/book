\chapter{Real Numbers}
\label{cha:real-numbers}

Topological reals vs contractible reals.

Two well-known constructions of reals. Cauchy Dedekind, we look at both.

\section{Cauchy Reals}
\label{sec:cauchy-reals}

Outline:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item performing the Cauchy construction on the rational once is problematic
  \item performing any construction ending with a quotient is probablematic
  \item But Hits work
  \item we get the minimal cmplete field.
  \item We obtain an hset, becase approx is a Prop
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dedekind Reals}
\label{sec:dedekind-reals}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Recall two-side cuts definition
\item discuss issues of size and impredicativity
\item replace Prop with the sigma-frame (Simpson), using HITs
\item Dedekind complete field, completeness wrt sigma-frames
\item This is a subset of an hSet
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison of Cacuhy and Dedekind Reals}
\label{sec:comp-cacuhy-dedek}

Cauchy embeds in Dedekind, we do not expect them to be the same (sheaf model over the
reals) Note, we do not use univalence, hence we have models in sSh(X).

They are the same if we have CAC for Sigma-predicates
Also, $Sigma = 2^N/\sim$.

\section{Compactness of $[0,1]$}
\label{sec:compactness-0-1}

Heine-Borel... Locales, or formal spaces, would be an alternative. The usual arguments
apply, but we will not go into them.

We obtain constructive mathematics, without countable choice. Little investigated.
See Richman. Note, we are still predicative.

With classical logic, we have Sigma=bool and fan-theorem, Heine-Borel.
